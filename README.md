# manjaro-iso-action

Tooling to build and distribute Manjaro on via Github Actions

## Usage example

This action ...

- installs the prerequisites to build Manjaro
- builds a ready to go Manjaro iso
- calculates hashes for the resulting image

It optionally provides:

- GPG-signing
- Distribution to Github Releases

The following example is a minimal "matrix strategy" setup, that builds minimal and full images for cinnamon, gnome and builds the images each on stable and testing repositories. Refer [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix) for more information on including / excluding permutations from matrix strategies.

All configuration options and defaults can be found [here](action.yml).

Instead of `manjaro/manjaro-iso-action@main`, please refer to the most current release (e.g. `manjaro/manjaro-iso-action@v1`).

### gpg signing

```yaml
- id: image-build
  uses: manjaro/manjaro-iso-action@main
  with:
    ...
    gpg-secret-key-base64: ${{ secrets.gpg_secret_base64 }}
    gpg-passphrase: ${{ secrets.GPG_PASSPHRASE }}
```

### caching

to get an idea how caching might work, please refer [here](.github/workflows/test.yml)

## Distribution channels

all distribution channels can be configured by setting / leaving out of their configuration variables.

### github release

```yaml
- id: image-build
  uses: manjaro/manjaro-iso-action@main
  with:
    ...
    release-tag: ${{ needs.prepare-release.outputs.release_tag }}
- name: rollback github release
  if: ${{ failure() || cancelled() }}
  run: |
    echo ${{ github.token }} | gh auth login --with-token
    gh release delete ${{ needs.prepare-release.outputs.release_tag }} -y --repo ${{ github.repository }}
    git push --delete origin ${{ needs.prepare-release.outputs.release_tag }}
```
